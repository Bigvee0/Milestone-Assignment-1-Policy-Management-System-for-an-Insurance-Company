# 🛡️ Insurance Policy Management System

## 📘 Overview

This project implements a modular policy management system for an insurance company using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Python. It allows for the management of policyholders, insurance products, and payments.

This solution meets the requirements for **Milestone Assignment 1**, which involves creating separate class files for managing:
- Policyholders
- Products
- Payments

And demonstrating the interaction of these classes using a main script.

## 🗂️ File Structure

- `policyholder.py`: Contains the `Policyholder` class and its methods (register, suspend, reactivate, add products, add payments).
- `product.py`: Contains the `Product` class with methods to create, update, and suspend insurance products.
- `payment.py`: Contains the `Payment` class with methods to process payments, send reminders, and apply penalties.
- `demo.py`: Main driver script that demonstrates the system's functionality using dummy data (policyholders, products, and payments).
- `README.md`: This documentation file.
